  <h2>Healing Ceremonies</h2>
  <p>
    So for now until we get this project bigger I'm going to start offering some value. 
    Until the project gets bigger and we get our ceremonial place I'm going to offer healing ceremonies at my home.
  <p>
     I'm going to accept you to my house where we live with my wife, daughter, dog, cat. 
    You'll fly in friday night and we'll have two sessions with magic mushrooms (amanita muscaria) in our city temple.
<h3>Price</h3>
€999 which includes 2 nights of accommodation at my place, food, a healing session consisting of 2 days. Talking / guiding through + integrating. 
<p>
I would want to offer this for free in the future to our community members and organise ceremonies with tens of people and many guides. 
    <h2>Option 2</h2>
    <p>
        We also thought about offering a second option - we send you the medicine by mail and guide you through your journey on zoom for a full 8-12 hours + 1 hour of integration next day. This one will save you the hassle of flying anywhere. 
        <p>
        We're not gonna load you up with heroic doses over Zoom. It's ok, we're taking it smooth and steady. 
      <h3>Price</h3>
      <p>
          €369
      </p>
Much Love Ya'll 🔥🤍💫
