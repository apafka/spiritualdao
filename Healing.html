  <h2>Healing Ceremonies</h2>
  <p>
    So for now until we get this project bigger I'm going to start offering some value. 
    Until the project gets bigger and we get our ceremonial place I'm going to offer healing ceremonies at my home.
  <p>
     I'm going to accept you to my house where we live with my wife, daughter, dog, cat. 
    You'll fly in friday night and we'll have two sessions with amanita mushroom in our city temple.
<h2>Price</h2>
€999 which includes 2 nights of accommodation at my place, food, a healing session consisting of 2 days. Talking / guiding through + integrating. 
<p>
I would want to offer this for free in the future to our dao & community members but at this point 
in our journey this is my only source of income to keep up this work.
<p>
Lets gooo 🔥🤍💫
