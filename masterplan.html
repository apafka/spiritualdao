  <h2>Post 1</h2>
  <p>
    I want to build something cool that i like myself and that i want to work on for the rest of my life.
  <p>
  For you reading right now - i’m gonna come up with a cooler / catchier / worthy name..
  <p>
  A lot of what this project is inspired from is from my healing journey with plant medicines (aka psychedelics but really they’re more like plants) like ayahuasca, peyote, mushrooms, marijuana, etc.
  <p>
  This decade plus journey transformed me from suicidal and narcisstic greedy sad person to a family man with big dreams and big cojones.
  <p>
  But i’m also inspired by elon, tesla, frank and degods, basecamp and shopify. But i’m also inspire and influenced by indigenous cultures amd shamans with whom i’ve lived with, from south and north american indigenous cultures and european and asian shamans.
  <p>
  I have a family - my wife, daughter, dog and cat. I want more children. I want to share my life with them traveling the world and living to a 100+ yrs.
  <p>
  I want sit around campfires playing the guitar, singing and guiding humanity through stories.
  <p>
  I also lile to build and code.
  <p>
  So the masterplan slash roadmap is:
  <p>

  Create awesome PFP art
  Build a community
  Build and bootstrap web 3 business
  Buy and build ceremonial resorts and gathering places
  Heal and enlighten the world. Don’t end up like Osho.
  <p>
  What this means
  <p>
  My current view / understanding is that I should create a PFP project. These things resonate in web 3.0. I dunno how many units in the collection - 3690 / 4444 / 8888?
  <p>
  When we launch we’re gonna. Wait, stop! Who’s the we? My family as guardians. Yeah. But i also need a team! To be determined. SoMeone with integrity amd preferably experience / interest in plant medicines / shamanism / spirituality.
  <p>
  Ok lets go.
  <p>
  Once we have the PFP’s ready and sold. Then lets build the community.
  <p>
  The main goal of this whole thing. My whole lifes work is about healing and enlightening through plant medicines around campfires.
  <p>
  So I’ll start foraging mushrooms from the forest in late summer. I’ll probably meet up and invite people from the community to meet Peyote and Ayahuasca shamans, who I know for a long time too.
  <p>
  Ok so the funds and monetisation.
  <p>
  My initial thoughts are that we will use these funds to keep the team alive and going while building.
  <p>
  For monetisation I like what thedogecapital and degods have done. I want to build like basecamp and shape up.
  <p>
  What are we gonna build? Honestly, I dunno! We’re gonna solve our own problems. To be continued on this.
  <p>
  I also think we’ll monetise through educational courses like Sorelle Amore and Aubrey Marcus. They inspire me what they’ve done but our educational content / courses would be about energy / healing / plant medicines / shamanism / psychogology / web 3 / etc.
  <p>
  We could also start selling physical products but I want to keep it all digital on this front.
  <p>
  So the end goal of this monetisation is to use these fund to:
  Build resorts around the world
  heal humanity through plant medicines
  Support musicians, shamans and healers globally
  advocate for the legalisation of plant medicines and use in therapy
  partner with maps, iceers and other organisations
  Make our community members and pass the woof to all of society 🐕🔥🤍💫
  <p>
  And I want to travel together with fam, make new friends, help and guide people, sing around campfires and tell stories.
  <p>
Lets gooo 🔥🤍💫
