      Ascending one soul,
      a day,
      forever.

      Have you ever wondered why you’re here? On this planet. We’re on a mission to help you figure this out. Together.

      Why? Because everyone deserves to live a fulfilling life to their maximum potential.

      How? By gathering around campfires, eating plant medicines (aka psychedelics) in the right set and setting, and singing songs of love.

      Mission - heal and enlighten billions through plant medicines and indigenous wisdom

      Vision - magic internet money to build retreat centres all over the world while building cool digital stuff to finance

      Roadmap

      1. Get NFT game going. Awesome art.
      2. Acquire enough capital to buy land to build first retreat and community centre.
      3. Forage medicinal mushrooms from nature and organise ceremonies / gatherings around campfires at community centre.
      3. Build product / service & sell educational content
      4. Rinse and repeat
